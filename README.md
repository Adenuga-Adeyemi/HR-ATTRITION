Creating My First Dashboard: Insights into HR Employee Attrition Rate

I am excited to share my experience in creating my first dashboard focused on an important area of Human Resources: employee attrition rate.

The dashboard I created provides a comprehensive overview of the workforce of 1,470 employees and sheds light on the attrition challenges. With a total of 237 employees having exited the organization, I find the organization facing an attrition rate of 16.12%. This statistics prompts critical discussions about employee engagement, organizational culture, and overall job satisfaction.

One of the most enlightening aspects of the analysis was examining the average years spent by employees before exiting. This metric helps  understand the longevity of workforce and offers insight into how I might improve retention strategies. It's essential to identify whether employees leave after a short duration or if there is a specific point in their career where they choose to exit. This information can guide our interventions and help the organization create a more supportive environment.

Moreover, the dashboard also explores the impact of age on employee retention. It is fascinating to observe how different age groups exhibit varying levels of loyalty and tenure within the company. 

Another crucial element included in the dashboard is the analysis of monthly income by gender. This aspect highlights potential disparities that may exist within our compensation structure and invites further investigation into gender equity within the organization. 

Additionally, examining the attrition rate by marital status has proven to be an insightful indicator of retention patterns. 

Through this dashboard, I have learned the importance of data visualization in HR analytics. The ability to present complex information in an easily digestible format is critical to engaging stakeholders and driving informed decision-making processes. I am eager to build on this foundation and delve deeper into other areas of HR analytics.


If you have any questions or insights regarding this project or related topics, please feel free to reach out. I look forward to engaging in fruitful discussions and continuing to learn from this dynamic field.
